### Tips
Try experimenting with comparison operators (`>`,`<`, `==`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the 'node' command in vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively - that means small pieces.

To help figure out how to use 'hungry' and 'availabletime' inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal.
```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry,availabletime){
    console.log('hungry is',hungry);
    console.log('avaiableTime is', availableTime);
}```
